# Unit 10, Lesson 01: Hello Recursion!

It's a new day! A new week, new unit, and new teacher.

## What's new?

Well, me. I've been trained, but I'm new at this. I will count on you all to help me figure out how to teach successfully.

### Method

Lectures? Let's code together instead!

### Grading

I'll not mess with the system. Syllabus says:

- 40% Exams
- 40% Labs
- 10% Quizzes
- 10% Assignments

For Unit 10, we'll continue Quizzes and Exams as before.

- Unit Exam next Friday, March 24th
- Quiz this Friday, March 17th. Except it's a day off. Quiz aborted?!
- "Bell Ringers" here and there.

For Assignments, I'm not sure about worksheets just yet. I want you to ~~write~~ type code!

- "Coding Together" (today, and most days) count as assignments. Credit/No-Credit, probably.
- Homework? occasionally. Like, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and request the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

For Labs, we'll aim for two "mini-labs" this unit. These will come with a rubric.

## Warm-up

For coding together, fire up your IDE of choice. I'll use Visual Studio Code.

Next, code a class with a `main` function, that prints something, compile, and run it.

## Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you should:

- Understand these concepts: recursion, iteration, and the call stack
- Be able to write recursive functions to solve simple problems

### Resources

- [The Recursive Book of Recursion](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/a/recursion)

## Lesson

Let's continue coding in your class. Add some functions which call each other.

For example: function `a()` calls function `b()` calls function `c()`.

### Understanding Recursion

- Print out entry and exit messages to illustrate the flow.
- Have you ever used the debugger? Let's try it!
- What is Recursion? Ask [Google](https://www.google.com/)
- Now let's code recursion. function `c()` calls function `a()` again or something.
- Java Call Stack & [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

### Recursion vs. Iteration

- Can we make Iteration overflow?
- Avoiding recursion overflows with cases: Base and Recursive, arguments closer to the base
- Code some terrible Recursion: Factorial, Fibonacci

### Classic Recursion Algorithms

- Code some less-terrible recursion: String reverse, detecting [palindromes](https://czechtheworld.com/best-palindromes/) like "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
- Tower of Hanoi: [Play](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)! [Read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). Code?

### Now You Do It!

- Write iterative and recursive functions which sum an array of numbers.
- Write a recursive function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, via the "Euclidean Algorithm".
  - Need help?

### Homework: Sign Up for GitHub

- It is easier to share code via a system designed for it.
- Even if this is your last CS class ever (noooooo!).
- You are a student, so request the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
  - And if you have a non-school email, add that too, such that you retain access to your account after you graduate.

### Knowledge Check

1. What is recursion?
2. What are the three parts of a recursive function?
3. What is the call stack, and a stack overflow?

## Closing

So far, recursion is just another "complicates your life" concept. In the days ahead, we'll see how it's useful.
