# Unit 10, Lesson 01: Hello Recursion!

It's a new day! A new week, new unit, and new teacher.

## What's new?

Well, me. I've been trained, but I'm new at this. I will count on you all to help me figure out how to teach successfully.

### Method

Lectures? Let's code together instead!

### Grading

I'll not mess with the system. Syllabus says:

- 40% Exams
- 40% Labs
- 10% Quizzes
- 10% Assignments

For Unit 10, we'll continue Quizzes and Exams as before.

- Unit Exam next Friday, March 24th
- Quiz this Friday, March 17th. Except it's a day off. Quiz aborted?!
- "Bell Ringers" here and there. Tomorrow, I think.

For Assignments, I'm not sure about worksheets just yet. I want you to ~~write~~ type code!

- "Coding Together" (today, and most days) count as assignments. Credit/No-Credit, probably.
- Homework? occasionally. Like, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and fork this "repo" (code repository). Recommended: request the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) for status.
  For Labs, we'll aim for two "mini-labs" this unit. Homemade.

## Warm-up

For coding together, fire up your IDE of choice. I'll use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack). You may continue with [jGRASP](https://www.jgrasp.org/) for now, but I highly recommend you switch, and I'll give you time to do that later this week. Let's have a bit of a sales pitch as to why you'll want to switch.

Next, code a class with a `main` function, that prints something, compile, and run it.

**Important**: save the code you write today, such that you can turn it in for credit.

## Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you should:

- Understand these concepts: recursion, iteration, and the call stack
- Be able to write recursive functions to solve simple problems
- Understand the base case, recursive case, and how recursive function arguments make recursion work.

### Resources

- [The Recursive Book of Recursion](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/) is our textbook for the next few days.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/a/recursion)

## Lesson

Let's continue coding in your class. Add some functions which call each other.

For example: function `a()` calls function `b()` calls function `c()`.

### Understanding Recursion

- Print out entry and exit messages to illustrate the flow. e.g., `System.out.println("a() begins");`
- Have you ever used the debugger? Let's try it! [jGRASP Instructions](https://www.jgrasp.org/tutorials187/06_Debugger.pdf)
- What is Recursion? Ask [Google](https://www.google.com/) & [book pictures](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/chapter1.html)
- Now let's code recursion. function `c()` calls function `a()` again or something.
- Java Call Stack & [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). How deep is the Java stack?

### Recursion vs. Iteration

- Can we make Iteration overflow?
- Avoiding recursion overflows with cases: Base and Recursive, arguments closer to the base
- Code some terrible Recursion: Factorial, [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)

### Classic Recursion Algorithms

- Code some less-terrible recursion: String reverse, detecting [palindromes](https://czechtheworld.com/best-palindromes/) like "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
- Tower of Hanoi: [Play](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)! [Read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). Code?

### Now You Do It!

- Write iterative and recursive functions which sum an array of numbers.
- Write a recursive function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, via the "Euclidean Algorithm".
  - Need help?

### Homework: Sign Up for [GitHub](https://github.com/)

#1-3 Due: Thursday, March 16, 2023, before class.

1. Sign up for an [account](https://github.com/), or perhaps you already have one.

- It is easier to share code via a system designed for it.
- Even if this is your last CS class ever (noooooo!).
- You are a student, so (optionally) request the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
  - And if you have a non-school email, add that too, such that you retain access to your account after you graduate.

2. after you have signed up, create a "fork" of [this repo](https://github.com/natoftheboonies/apcs-2023).
3. finally, send me (how? TBD!) a link to your fork of this repo.
4. Got more time? Beat the rush, see [Sponge](#Sponge) below.
5. Still not satisfied? Code some recursive functions!

On Thursday, we will add your "coding together" work from Monday and Tuesday to your repo.

### Knowledge Check

1. What is recursion?
2. What are the three parts of a recursive function?
3. What is the call stack, and a stack overflow?

## Closing

So far, recursion is just another "complicates your life" concept. In the days ahead, we'll see how it's useful.

## Sponge

Already done your homework? Let's try a [Codespaces devcontainer](https://github.com/features/codespaces). This enables coding on your Chromebook!

1. Navigate to your fork of this repo in your github account, click the green/blue "Code" button dropdown, "Codespaces" tab, and "Create codespace on main".
2. Wait for it (a few minutes) to build your container. The result should be a the web version of "Visual Studio Code" running in your browser.
3. Continue to wait for it (a few more minutes) to install extensions. You can watch the progress by clicking the gear icon in the bottom-left corner, and opening the Extensions dialog. We are installing "Extension Pack for Java"
4. After the Java extensions are installed, click the gear icon and open Settings. In the dialog which opens, search for `java.server` where it shows "Java > Server: Launch Mode". Due to a ['lil bug](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/2968) in version 1.15, we need to change this from "Hybrid" to "Standard". If your "Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat" plugin is beyond v1.15, this should no longer be necessary.
5. Maybe it will prompt you to restart your container, but if it does not, restart it anyway. Click the green/blue "Codespaces" navigation in the very bottom-left corner, and select "Rebuild Container" ("Full" is not necessary).

Now you're ready to code! Create a Java class, add a `main` method which prints something, and run it.

When you are done playing, click the green/blue "Codespaces" navigation and "Stop Current Codespace".

Then go back to your github account, and navigate to "Settings" under your account bubble in the top-right corner. Select "Billing and plans" in the left navigation. Scroll down to Codespaces, and note the Usage hours. Github provides a generous plan (plenty for this course), and if you sign up for the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) you get even more free.

Next, navigate to "Codespaces" in the section below. Scroll down to "Default idle timeout" and change it if you like. I set mine to "15 minutes".

Now you are set up to code with Codespaces. If you have access to another computer with Java and an IDE, you don't need to use Codespaces. It is still worth configuring, as (1) you might find it useful someday (you can now code anywhere with a browser and an internet connection), and (2) you can now help others who might need this to code.
