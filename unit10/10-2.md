# Unit 10, Lesson 02: Recursion: Not All Bad?!

Hey, look! I came back! Some of you even did your homework already! üòç

## Warm-up

1. Bell Ringer 6A ([p's & q's](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/p's%20and%20q's))

2. Let's compute factorials!

Please start your IDE and implement an iterative (using a loop) function `int factorial(int n) {...}` which calculates the factorial of a number _n_. Pseudocode:

```
  result = 1
  for i from n down to 1:
    result *= i
  return result
```

Test cases:

- `factorial(5) == 120`
- `factorial(4) == 24`

That's right, we're going to write this recursively next. Note that `factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4)`.

What is the [base case](https://www.thoughtco.com/why-does-zero-factorial-equal-one-3126598)?

## Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you should:

- Consider that recursion could be useful.
- Be familiar with divide-and-conquer as it relates to recursion.

### Resources

- [The Recursive Book of Recursion](https://inventwithpython.com/recursion/), Chapters 1-3.

## Lesson

You never _need_ to use recursion, but some problems are well suited to recursion. Let's see if we get to them.

### Recursion vs. Iteration

- Together, now: let's code factorial recursively. Why is this better or worse than the loop?
- Recall [yesterday](10-1.md): we avoid recursion overflows with cases: Base and Recursive, arguments approaching the base case.
  - without a base case, we recurse forever and overflow the stack.
    - if we never reach the base case, we also overflow.
  - without a recursive case, our function is ordinary, not recursive.
- Code some more terrible recursion: [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) looks promising...

### Classic Recursion Algorithms

Code some less-terrible recursion:

- String reverse,
- detecting [palindromes](https://czechtheworld.com/best-palindromes/) like "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" `.replaceAll(" ", "").toLowerCase()`

[See below](#sponge) for more.

### Math, Yay!

Create a static function to calculate _a<sup>b</sup>_ without using `Math.pow`.

Here is an iterative solution, or write your own.

```java
static int power(int a, int b) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
        result *= a;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Add a `main` method to check (via printing out) that `power(2,12)` returns `4096`.

### Divide and conquer

- Implement recursive exponent calculation
- See how it is improved by using divide-and-conquer strategy: `exp(a,n) = exp(a,n/2)*exp(a,n/2)` vs. `= a*exp(a, n-1)` and the variation if n is odd.

### Knowledge Check

1. How can we use "divide and conquer" for recursion
2. What are some reasons that recursion is _worse_ than iteration?

## Closing

We practiced several recursive algorithms, but still did not find a compelling case for recursion. Next time we fix that.

- Introducing Thursday's project: exploring [ACFL](https://www.friendsoftheacfl.org/acfl-overview/).

## Homework!

Due Monday, March 20, 1pm. Commit `PiDay.java` to your github repo.

Hey, It's Pi Day! ü•ß! 3.14159265... is not just a number you can memorize to impress your friends.

The math can be overwhelming, but here are a couple options to [calculate Pi with an infinite series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Rate_of_convergence). Please select one of them, and implement a recursive function: `static double piDay(int n, boolean subtract)`.

- Note that the series is infinite, which means a "correct" algorithm will overflow the stack. To avoid this, add a base case that stops the recursion at some point, say when `n == 1000`.
- Also note the sign switch every other term. Hint: use `subtract` to multiply by -1 or not.

```java
public class PiDay {

    // infinite series for œÄ
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Rate_of_convergence
    public static double piDay(int n, boolean subtract) {
      // TODO
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        //  Gregory‚ÄìLeibniz
        //double pi = piDay(1, false);

        // Nilakantha
        double pi = 3.0 + piDay(3, false);

        System.out.println("pi = " + pi);
    }
}
```

You are also welcome to code this iteratively, in addition to your recursive implementation.

### Now You Do It!

- Write a recursive function to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers, via the "Euclidean Algorithm".
  - Need help? [RIT.edu](https://www.rit.edu/academicsuccesscenter/sites/rit.edu.academicsuccesscenter/files/documents/math-handouts/DM6_EuclideanAlgorithm_BP_9_22_14.pdf#page=3) or search the web.
  - Test case: `euclid(15996751, 3870378) == 4057`
- Tower of Hanoi: [Play](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html)! [Read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). Code? Nah...
- Still want more? Write iterative and recursive functions which sum an array of numbers. Which function do you prefer?
  - Here are some: `int[] nums = { 3, 7, 4, 2, 36, 23, 4, 2, 9, 78, 34, 23, 1, 2, 6, 23 };`
